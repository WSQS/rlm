# RLM

The code in this repo is inspired by [rlms](https://github.com/alexzhang13/rlm).

Programmatic Tool Calling (PTC) and other similar technology allow llm to output code to running in an repl environment.

Recursive Language Models (RLMs) makes one step further, the model can recursively call it self to handle long context.
